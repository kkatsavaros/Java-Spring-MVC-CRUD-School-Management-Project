Java-SpringMVC-CRUD-School-Management-System


With that Programm we can use Java Spring MVC Framework to connect with database, Create, Read, Update, and Delete using Maven and Hibernate.


It is the continuation of Java Standard Edition School Management Project.

In that project i use Spring MVC and JSP Pages.

I have made an CRUD (Create - Read - Update - Delete) only for Trainers table.

The database is the schoolmanagement.sql

That project is very useful to getting familiar with MVC theory.
